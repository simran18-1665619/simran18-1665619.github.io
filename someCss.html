<h1> Seattle Is A Beautiful Place To Be </h1>
<br>
<p class="ex1">
    Seattle, a city on Puget Sound in the Pacific Northwest, is surrounded by water, mountains and evergreen forests, and contains thousands of acres of parkland. 
    Washington State’s largest city, it’s home to a large tech industry, with Microsoft and Amazon headquartered in its metropolitan area. 
    The futuristic Space Needle, a 1962 World’s Fair legacy, is its most iconic landmark.

    As the city transforms with taller and taller buildings, Seattle this summer had 58 construction cranes reshaping the skyline — more than any other city in the country, according to recent data.
    The city has more cranes than New York and San Francisco combined. It has twice as many as Chicago, Washington, D.C., or Portland.
